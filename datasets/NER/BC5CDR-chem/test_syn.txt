BACKGROUND O
: O
Acetaminophen O

are O
widely O
used O

OBJECTIVE O
: O
We O
evaluated O
the O

METHODS O
: O
We O
studied O

with O
hypersensitivity O
to O
P B

The O
diagnosis O

CONCLUSION O
: O
Only O
one O

was O
documented O
among O

Thus O

OBJECTIVES O
: O
The O
present O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
answer O
these O
questions O
, O
using O
a O
rodent O
model O
of O
early O
childhood O
Pb B
exposure O
and O
treatment O
with O
succimer O
, O
a O
widely O
used O
chelating O
agent O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
Pb O
poisoning O
. O

RESULTS O
: O
Pb B
exposure O
produced O
lasting O
impairments O
in O
learning O
, O
attention O
, O
inhibitory O
control O
, O
and O
arousal O
regulation O
, O
paralleling O
the O
areas O
of O

seen O
in O
Pb B

exposed O
children O
. O

Succimer O
treatment O
of O
the O
Pb B
- O
exposed O
rats O
significantly O
improved O
learning O
, O
attention O
, O
and O
arousal O
regulation O
, O
although O
the O
efficacy O
of O
the O
treatment O
varied O
as O
a O
function O
of O
the O
Pb B
exposure O
level O
and O
the O
specific O
functional O
deficit O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
succimer O
treatment O
of O
rats O
not O
previously O
exposed O
to O
Pb B
produced O
lasting O
and O
pervasive O
cognitive O
and O
affective O
dysfunction O
comparable O
in O
magnitude O
to O
that O
produced O
by O
the O
higher O
Pb B
exposure O
regimen O
. O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
These O
are O
the O
first O
data O
, O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
to O
show O
that O
treatment O
with O
any O
chelating O
agent O
can O
alleviate O
cognitive O
deficits O
due O
to O
Pb B
exposure O
. O

These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
it O
may O
be O
possible O
to O
identify O
a O
succimer O
treatment O
protocol O
that O
improves O
cognitive O
outcomes O
in O
Pb B
- O
exposed O
children O
. O

However O
, O
they O
also O
suggest O
that O
succimer O
treatment O
should O
be O
strongly O
discouraged O
for O
children O
who O
do O
not O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Renal O

PURPOSE O
: O
To O

the O

PTRA O
with O
that O
of O

This O

CONCLUSION O
: O
In O
this O

The O

The O

The O

Pretreatment O
of O

prior O

resulted O
in O

reduction O
of O

but O
not O

This O
result O
was O
not O
due O
to O
altered O
disposition O

either O

in O

or O
renal O
cortical O

Rather O
, O

pretreatment O
reduced O

and O
75 O
% O
after O
APAP B
doses O
of O
750 O

900 O
mg O

BNPP O
did O
not O
alter O
the O
excretion O
of O
APAP B

any O
of O
its O
non O

deacetylated O
metabolites O
nor O
did O

or O
its O
metabolites O
after O
PAP O
doses O
of O
150 O

Therefore O
, O
the O
BNPP O
- O
induced O
reduction O
in O
APAP B

induced O

appears O
to O
be O
due O
to O

. O

It O
is O
concluded O
that O

at O
