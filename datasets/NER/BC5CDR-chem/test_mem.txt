aspects O

Heparin B
, O
first O
used O

, O
has O
been O
clinically O
used O
to O
treat O
thrombosis O
for O
more O
than O
50 O
years O
. O

Although O
several O
new O
anticoagulant O
drugs O
are O
in O
development O
, O
heparin B
remains O
the O
anticoagulant O
of O
choice O
to O
treat O
acute O
thrombotic O
episodes O
. O

The O
clinical O
effects O
of O
heparin B
are O
meritorious O
, O
but O
side O

do O
exist O
. O

Bleeding O

the O
primary O

Major O
bleeding O
is O
of O
primary O
concern O
in O
patients O
receiving O

However O
, O
additional O
important O

effects O
of O

include O
heparin B

thrombocytopenia O
, O
alopecia O
, O
transaminasemia O
, O
hyperkalemia O
, O
hypoaldosteronism O
, O
and O
priapism O
. O

These O
side O
effects O
are O
relatively O
rare O
in O
a O
given O
individual O
, O
but O
given O
the O
extremely O
widespread O
use O

some O
are O
quite O

Although O
reasonable O

be O
" O

PURPOSE O
: O
Prenatal O
cocaine B

has O
been O
linked O

the O
formation O
of O

that O
are O

on O

We O

to O
determine O
if O

cocaine B

increases O
the O
incidence O

in O

Infants O
were O

: O
those O

Infants O
were O

group O
if O
there O
was O
a O

if O

The O
incidence O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
We O
found O
an O

( O

) O
prior O

at O
3 O

during O
treatment O
. O

Thalidomide B
was O
discontinued O
in O
55 O
patients O
for O
lack O
of O

. O

Of O
67 O
patients O
initially O

may O
thus O
be O
a O

complication O
of O

The O
participation O
of O
reactive O
oxygen B
species O
in O
aminoglycoside B

has O
been O
deduced O
from O
observations O
that O

catalyze O
the O
formation O
of O
superoxide B
radicals O
in O

and O
that O
antioxidants O
attenuate O
ototoxicity O
in O

. O

We O
therefore O
hypothesized O
that O
overexpression O
of O
Cu O
/ O
Zn O
- O
superoxide B
dismutase O
( O
h O
- O
SOD1 O
) O
should O
protect O

. O

In O
nontransgenic O
animals O
, O
the O
threshold O
in O
the O
kanamycin B

treated O
group O
was O
45 O

50 O

higher O
than O
in O

In O
the O
transgenic O
group O
, O
kanamycin B
increased O
the O
threshold O
by O
only O
15 O
dB O
over O
the O
respective O
controls O
. O

The O
protection O
by O
overexpression O
of O
superoxide B
dismutase O
supports O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
oxidant O
stress O
plays O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
aminoglycoside B

The O

Neither O

The O

that O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Focal O
subtenon O
carboplatin B

have O
recently O
been O
used O
as O
a O
presumably O
toxicity O

adjunct O
to O

OBJECTIVE O
: O
To O
report O
our O
clinical O
experience O
with O
abnormal O
ocular O
motility O
in O
patients O
treated O
with O
subtenon O
carboplatin B
chemotherapy O
. O

METHODS O
: O
We O
noted O
abnormal O
ocular O
motility O
in O
10 O
consecutive O
patients O
with O
retinoblastoma O
who O
had O
received O
subtenon O
carboplatin B

RESULTS O
: O
Limitation O
of O

was O
detected O
in O
all O

with O
1 O
to O
6 O
injections O
of O
subtenon O
carboplatin B
as O
part O
of O
multimodality O

. O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Subtenon O
carboplatin B
chemotherapy O
is O
associated O
with O
significant O
fibrosis O
of O
orbital O
soft O
tissues O
, O
leading O
to O
mechanical O
restriction O
of O

and O
making O

. O

Subtenon O
carboplatin B
is O
not O

, O
and O
its O

is O

The O
topical O

of O
a O

appeared O
to O
be O
safe O
, O
efficacious O

were O
treated O
with O
bromocriptine B

One O

however O
, O
developed O
worsened O
psychiatric O
symptoms O
while O
taking O

Thus O
, O
three O
of O
six O

had O
their O

This O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Tacrolimus B

of O

that O

We O

CONCLUSIONS O

Our O

that O
the O

To O
gain O
insight O

the O
mechanism O

this O

that O
the O

The O

directly O
activate O
either O

that O
the O

Based O
upon O
these O
results O

we O
conclude O
that O
amiodarone B

that O
the O

: O
Despite O
its O
well O

known O
cardiotoxicity O
, O
the O
anthracyclin O
doxorubicin B
( O
DOX B
) O
continues O
to O
be O
an O
effective O
and O
widely O
used O

agent O

DOX B

induced O

damage O

results O
from O
the O
formation O
of O
free O

by O
DOX B
. O

Reactive O
oxygen B
species O

affect O
the O
cardiac O
myocytes O
because O
these O

seem O
to O
have O
a O
relatively O

system O
. O

The O

) O
showed O
cardioprotection O
against O
DOX B

induced O

through O
its O

properties O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
relatively O
short O
final O
half O
- O
life O
of O
monoHER O
( O
about O
30 O
min O
) O
, O
it O
is O
expected O
that O
the O
time O

DOX B
might O
be O
of O

Administration O

Because O
levodopa B
increases O
both O
phasic O

dopaminergic O
neurotransmission O
, O
the O
critical O
mechanism O

the O

The O

Subjects O

The O

These O

that O

impairs O

Thus O

BACKGROUND O
: O

: O
The O

We O
conclude O
that O

Methamphetamine B
( O

This O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Cisplatin B

. O

One O
of O
the O
major O
complications O
of O
cisplatin B
use O
is O

. O

There O
are O
many O
strategies O
to O
prevent O
this O
toxicity O
, O
including O
the O
use O
of O
mannitol B
as O
a O
nephroprotectant O
in O
combination O
with O

. O

OBJECTIVE O
: O
We O
aimed O
to O

the O

in O

METHODS O
: O
This O

was O
a O

created O
by O

Data O
were O

as O
an O

from O

2011 O

RESULTS O
: O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
When O
limited O

it O
should O

to O

Metronidazole B

We O
present O
a O

The O

Emerging O

that O

Na B

have O
pivotal O
roles O
in O
the O
cardiotoxicity O
of O
aconitine O
. O

However O
, O
no O
reports O
are O
available O
on O
the O
role O
of O
Ca B
( O
2 O

) O
in O
aconitine O

. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
we O
explored O
the O
importance O
of O
pathological O
Ca B
( O
2 O
+ O
) O
signaling O
in O
aconitine O
poisoning O
in O

and O
in O

. O

We O
found O
that O
Ca B
( O
2 O

) O
overload O
lead O
to O
accelerated O
beating O
rhythm O
in O
adult O
rat O
ventricular O

and O
caused O

To O

, O
we O
performed O

in O
neonatal O
rat O

, O
as O

The O

) O

demonstrated O
that O
aconitine O
promoted O

Hence O
, O
our O
results O
suggest O
that O
aconitine O
significantly O
aggravates O
Ca B
( O

overload O
and O

This O

The O
epidemiology O

is O
not O
fully O
understood O
. O

Experimental O
studies O
in O
healthy O

indicate O
aminoglycosides B
cause O
proximal O
tubular O
damage O
in O
most O
patients O
, O
but O
rarely O
, O
if O
ever O
, O
cause O
glomerular O
or O
tubular O
dysfunction O
. O

Clinical O
trials O
of O
aminoglycosides B
in O
seriously O
ill O
patients O
indicate O
that O
the O
relative O
risk O
for O
developing O
acute O
renal O
failure O
during O
therapy O
ranges O
from O
8 O
to O
10 O
and O
that O
the O

risk O
is O
70 O
% O

80 O
% O
. O

We O
conclude O
that O

increases O

by O
increasing O

cardiac O

, O
and O
that O
propranolol B

by O
reversing O
the O

of O
PPA B
on O

. O

That O
propranolol B
antagonizes O
the O
pressor O
effect O
of O
PPA B
is O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
interaction O
in O
which O
propranolol B
enhances O
the O
pressor O
effect O
of O
norepinephrine B
. O

This O
is O
probably O
because O
PPA B

less O

than O
does O

The O
role O

examined O
. O

Vasopressin B
plays O
a O
major O
role O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O

DOCA O

since O

Furthermore O
, O
the O

vasopressin B
appears O
to O
be O
important O
in O
the O
development O

this O
model O

since O
the O
enhanced O
pressor O
responsiveness O
to O
the O

was O
observed O
in O
the O
initial O
stage O
of O
hypertension O
. O

Increased O
secretion O
of O
vasopressin B
from O

also O
promotes O
the O

as O
a O
pathogenetic O
factor O
in O

. O

An O
unproportional O
release O
of O
vasopressin B
