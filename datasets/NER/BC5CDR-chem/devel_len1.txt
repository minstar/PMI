In O

CONCLUSIONS O

These O

prevent O
the O

hyperparathyroidism O
because O
it O
does O
not O
induce O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
increasing O
evidence O
has O
suggested O
that O
the O

molecule O
nitric B
oxide I
( O
NO B
) O
is O
involved O
in O
pain O
mechanisms O
of O
migraine O
without O

In O
order O
to O
clarify O
whether O
the O
same O
is O
true O
for O
migraine O
with O
aura O
, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
we O
examined O
the O

Headache O
was O
more O
severe O
in O

in O
the O
controls O
during O

immediately O
after O
GTN B

( O

as O
during O

In O
the O

, O
the O
GTN B

headache O
gradually O
disappeared O
, O
whereas O
in O

peak O
headache O
intensity O
occurred O
at O
a O
mean O
time O
of O
240 O
min O

The O
results O
therefore O
suggest O
that O
NO B
is O
involved O
in O
the O
pain O
mechanisms O
of O
migraine O
with O

. O

Since O

this O

may O

We O

After O

it O
is O

Amiodarone B

The O
pulmonary O

of O
amiodarone B
is O
thought O
to O
result O
from O

Using O

Our O

that O

BACKGROUND O
: O
More O
than O
3 O
decades O
after O
Jones O
and O
Smith O
( O
1973 O
) O
reported O
on O
the O
devastation O
caused O
by O
alcohol B
exposure O
on O
fetal O
development O
, O
the O
rates O
of O
heavy O
drinking O
during O
pregnancy O
remain O
relatively O
unchanged O
. O

Early O
identification O
of O
fetal O
alcohol B
exposure O
and O
maternal O
abstinence O
led O
to O
better O
infant O
outcomes O
. O

This O
study O
examined O
the O
utility O
of O
biometry O
for O
detecting O
alcohol B
- O
related O
fetal O

. O

METHODS O
: O
We O
obtained O
fetal O
ultrasound O
measures O
from O
routine O

for O
167 O
pregnant O
hazardous O
drinkers O
who O
were O
enrolled O
in O
a O
brief O

. O

Because O
intensity O
of O
alcohol B

is O
associated O
with O
poorer O
fetal O

, O
separate O

were O
conducted O
for O

When O
women O
reportedly O
quit O

early O
in O

, O
fetal O

were O
not O
significantly O

Any O

among O

resulted O
in O
reduced O

as O
well O

in O

women O
who O
either O

Although O
the O

is O
a O
limitation O
in O
this O

these O

INTRODUCTION O
: O
Ethambutol B

used O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
tuberculosis O
, O
which O
is O
still O

in O
Southeast O

loss O

: O

stopping O
ethambutol B
on O
diagnosis O
, O
visual O
function O
continued O
to O
deteriorate O
for O
a O
few O
months O
. O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Ethambutol B
usage O
is O
associated O
with O
permanent O
visual O
loss O
and O
should O
be O
avoided O
if O

The O

OBJECTIVE O
: O
The O

of O
this O

was O
to O
investigate O
whether O
fluoxetine B

RESULTS O
: O
The O
prolactin O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Tamoxifen B
is O
a O
candidate O
chemopreventive O
agent O
in O
breast O
cancer O
, O
although O
the O
drug O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O

cancer O
. O

Therefore O
we O
did O
a O
trial O
in O

tamoxifen B
as O
a O
chemopreventive O
. O

METHODS O
: O
In O

, O
we O

tamoxifen B
in O

( O

who O
did O
not O
have O

cancer O
and O
who O
had O
had O
a O
hysterectomy O
. O

Women O
were O
randomised O
to O
receive O
tamoxifen B
20 O
mg O
per O
day O
or O
placebo O
, O
both O
orally O
for O
5 O
years O
. O

There O
is O
no O
difference O
in O

between O
the O
placebo O
( O
22 O

) O
and O

There O
is O
a O

among O
women O
receiving O

who O
also O
used O

therapy O
during O
the O
trial O
: O
among O
390 O
women O
on O
such O
therapy O
and O
allocated O
to O

, O
we O
found O
eight O
cases O
of O

with O

INTERPRETATION O
: O
Although O
