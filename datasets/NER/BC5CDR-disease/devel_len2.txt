BACKGROUND O
: O
Calcitriol O
therapy O
suppresses O
serum O
levels O
of O
parathyroid O
hormone O
( O
PTH O
) O
in O
patients O
with O
renal B

has O
several O
drawbacks O
, O
including O
hypercalcemia B
and O
/ O
or O
marked O
suppression B
of I
bone I
turnover I
, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
adynamic B
bone I
disease I
. O

RESULTS O
: O
In O

significantly O

CONCLUSIONS O

DISCUSSION O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
The O

show O
considerable O

This O
is O
consistent O
with O

that O
show O
predominant O

of O
parvo O

cellular O

Hypoxia B

We O
then O
applied O
this O
animal O
model O
to O
the O
detection O
of O
tubulointerstitial O
hypoxia B
in O
the O
diseased B

With O
this O

we O
were O
able O
to O
identify O
diffuse O

hypoxia B
in O
the O
puromycin O

induced O
nephrotic B

and O
focal O

hypoxia B
in O

. O

The O
degree O
of O
hypoxia B
showed O
a O
positive O
correlation O
with O
microscopic O
tubulointerstitial B

in O
both O
models O
. O

We O
propose O
here O
a O
possible O

Hemolytic B

is O
one O
of O
the O
major O
adverse O
events O
of O
the O
combination O

Because O
of O

is O
a O

in O

It O
has O

a O

technique O
for O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
whether O
myocardial O
contrast O
echocardiography O
performed O
with O
a O
stable O
solution O
of O
sonicated O
albumin O
could O
detect O
regions O
of O
myocardial O
underperfusion O
resulting O
from O
various O
degrees O
of O
coronary B
stenosis I
. O

During O
a O
transient O
( O
20 O
- O

) O
coronary B
occlusion I
, O
a O
perfusion O
defect O
was O
observed O
with O
contrast O
echocardiography O
in O
14 O
of O
the O
15 O
dogs O
in O
which O
the O
occlusion O
was O
produced O
. O

During O
dipyridamole O
- O
induced O
hyperemia B
, O
12 O
of O
the O
16 O
dogs O
with O
a O
partial O
coronary B
stenosis I
had O
a O
visible O
area O
of O
hypoperfusion O
by O
contrast O
echocardiography O
. O

Thus O
, O
myocardial O
contrast O
echocardiography O
can O
be O
used O
to O
visualize O
and O
quantitate O
the O
amount O
of O
jeopardized O
myocardium O
during O
moderate O
to O
severe O
degrees O
of O
coronary B
stenosis I
. O

We O
investigated O
the O

between O

and O

of O

Spinal B

was O
induced O
by O
aortic B
occlusion I
for O
6 O

Second O
, O
we O
investigated O
the O

of O
IT O

on O
the O
histopathologic O
changes O
in O
the O
spinal O

after O

. O

IT O

after O

- O
induced O
spastic B
paraparesis I
compared O
with O
the O

. O

These O
data O
indicate O
that O
IT O
morphine O
induces O
spastic B
paraparesis I
with O
a O
concomitant O
increase O
in O
CSF O

, O
which O

We O

: O
We O
explore O
the O
protective O

of O
Nrf2 O
against O
diabetic B

using O
human O

RESULTS O
: O
The O
glomeruli O
of O
human O
diabetic B
nephropathy I
patients O
were O
under O
oxidative O
stress O
and O
had O
elevated O
Nrf2 O
levels O
. O

In O
the O
animal O

, O
Nrf2 O
was O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
crucial O
in O
ameliorating O
streptozotocin O
- O

renal B

. O

This O
is O
evident O
by O

mice O
having O
higher O
ROS O

and O

and O

compared O
with O
Nrf2 O

) O
mice O
. O

Mechanistic O
studies O
in O
both O
in O

and O
in O

systems O
showed O
that O
the O
Nrf2 O
- O
mediated O
protection O
against O
diabetic B
nephropathy I
is O
, O
at O

, O
partially O
through O

of O
