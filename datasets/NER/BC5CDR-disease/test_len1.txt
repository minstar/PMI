BACKGROUND O
: O
This O
study O
examined O
the O
role O
of O
phase O

early O

( O
EAD O
) O
in O
producing O
a O
trigger O
to O

) O
with O

by O

The O
contribution O
of O

of O

( O

) O
to O
transmural O
propagation O
of O
EAD O
and O
the O

of O

was O
also O
evaluated O
. O

An O
increase O
in O
TDR O
by O
dl O
- O
sotalol O
facilitated O
transmural O
propagation O
of O

that O
initiated O
multiple O

TdP B
in O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
This O
study O
provides O
the O
first O
direct O
evidence O
from O
intracellular O
action O
potential O
recordings O
that O
phase O
2 O

can O
be O
generated O
from O

produce O

Patients O

Two O

Thalidomide O

We O
prospectively O
evaluated O
thalidomide O
- O
induced O
neuropathy B
using O
electrodiagnostic O

. O

Six O
patients O
developed O

Neuropathy B
may O

be O
a O

The O
participation O
of O
reactive O

in O
aminoglycoside O

been O
deduced O

observations O
that O
aminoglycoside O
- O
iron O

catalyze O
the O
formation O
of O

and O
that O

We O

The O

supports O
the O
hypothesis O
that O

plays O
a O

With O

However O
, O
livers O
from O

were O
strikingly O

OBJECTIVE O

To O
assess O

prednisone O
( O

produces O
anxiety B

Anxiety B
was O
assessed O

an O

: O
Anxiety B

The O

Physical O

Regular O
motor O
activity O
has O
many O
benefits O
for O
mental O
and O
physical O
condition O
but O
its O
implications O
for O
epilepsy B
are O
still O
controversial O
. O

In O
order O
to O
elucidate O
this O
problem O
, O
we O
have O
studied O
the O
effect O
of O
long O
- O
term O
physical O
activity O
on O
susceptibility O
to O
subsequent O
seizures B
. O

Thereafter O
, O
seizures B
were O
induced O
by O
pilocarpine O
injections O
in O
trained O
and O
non O

trained O
control O
groups O
. O

During O
the O
acute O
period O
of O
status B
epilepticus I
, O
we O
measured O
: O
( O

) O
the O
latency O
of O
the O
first O
motor O
sign O
, O
( O

the O

( O

) O
the O
time O
when O
it O
occurred O
within O
the O
6 O

observation O
period O
, O
and O
( O
4 O
) O
the O
time O
when O
the O
acute O
period O
ended O
. O

All O
these O
behavioral O
parameters O
showed O
statistically O
significant O
changes O
suggesting O
that O
regular O
physical O
exercises O
decrease O
susceptibility O
to O
subsequently O
induced O
seizures B
and O
ameliorate O
the O
course O
of O
experimentally O

, O
phasic O

seems O
to O
be O
the O
critical O
mechanism O
by O
which O
dopamine O
enhances O

groups O
in O

Chloroacetaldehyde O
( O

) O
is O
a O
metabolite O
of O
the O
alkylating O
agent O
ifosfamide O
( O
IFO O

and O
putatively O
responsible O
for O

following O

Toxicity B

, O

CAA O
reduced O

induced O
a O

intracellular O
thiols O

Acidification O
, O
which O
slowed O
the O
reaction O

CAA O

, O
could O
also O
attenuate O

CAA O
on O

, O
thiol O

non O

mediating O
its O

Therefore O

urinary O
acidification O
could O
be O
an O
option O

It O

OBJECTIVES O

Neuropsychiatric O

problem O
in O

. O

The O

was O
used O
as O
a O
model O
of O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
The O
data O
suggest O
that O
neuropsychiatric B

are O
more O

an O
interaction O

PURPOSE O
: O
To O
compare O
the O
susceptibility O
to O
nephrotoxic B
effect O
of O
CM O
in O
patients O
undergoing O
PTRA O
with O
that O
of O

The O
effectiveness O
of O
PTRA O
on O

seems O
to O
be O
barely O
influenced O
by O

We O
conclude O
that O
an O
H1 O

may O
be O
useful O
in O
preventing O
hypotension B

by O

how O

We O
present O
a O

However O
, O
no O

on O
the O

In O
this O

we O
explored O
the O

Ca O
( O

in O
aconitine O

We O
found O
that O

lead O
to O

in O

To O

, O
we O
performed O

Hence O

our O

OBJECTIVES O
: O
This O
work O
summarizes O
research O
on O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
that O
underlie O
the O
increased O

cancer B

that O

DISCUSSION O
: O
Epigenetic O

in O

, O
the O
development O
of O
cancer B

, O
and O

are O
plausible O

mechanisms O
by O
which O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Evidence O
is O
mounting O
that O
relates O

This O

with O
the O

Haloperidol O
decreased O
the O

the O
lowering O

did O
not O
reach O

The O
