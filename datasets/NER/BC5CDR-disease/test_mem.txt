OBJECTIVES O
: O
The O

to O
determine O
whether O
the O
use O
of O

Bromocriptine O

Asterixis B
induced O
by O
carbamazepine O
therapy O
. O

There O
are O
very O
few O
reports O
about O
asterixis B
as O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
treatment O
with O
psychopharmacologic O
agents O
. O

In O
this O
report O
we O
present O
four O
patients O
treated O
with O
a O
combination O
of O
different O
psychotropic O
drugs O
, O
in O
whom O
asterixis B
was O
triggered O
either O
by O
adding O
carbamazepine O
( O
CBZ O
) O
to O
a O
treatment O
regimen O
, O
or O
by O
increasing O
its O
dosage O
. O

We O
consider O
asterixis B
to O
be O
an O
easily O
overlooked O
sign O
of O
neurotoxicity B
, O
which O
may O
occur O
even O
at O
low O
or O
moderate O
dosage O
levels O
, O
if O
certain O
drugs O
as O
lithium O
or O
clozapine O
are O
used O
in O

with O
CBZ O

Pharmacodynamics O

levodopa O
were O
examined O
in O
parkinsonian B
patients O
with O

responses O
to O
levodopa O
. O

The O
magnitude O
of O
the O
hypotensive B
effect O
of O
levodopa O
was O
concentration O
dependent O
and O
was O
fit O
to O
an O
Emax O
model O
in O

Stable O
responders O
demonstrated O
a O
small O
hypotensive B
response O
. O

Baseline O
blood O

were O
higher O
in O
fluctuating O
patients O
; O
a O

correlated O

barrier O
, O
reduced O
the O
hypotensive B
and O

levodopa O
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
levodopa O
has O
a O
central O
hypotensive B
action O
that O
parallels O
the O
motor O
effects O
in O
fluctuating O
patients O
. O

The O
hypotensive B

appears O
to O
be O
related O

CONCLUSION O

many O
benefits O
for O

but O
its O
implications O
for O

are O
still O
controversial O
. O

In O
order O
to O

this O
problem O

we O
have O
studied O
the O
effect O

Thereafter O
, O

During O
the O

we O
measured O

. O

All O
these O
behavioral O

showed O
statistically O
significant O
changes O
suggesting O
that O
regular O

decrease O

ameliorate O

The O

Chloroacetaldehyde O
as O
a O
sulfhydryl O
reagent O
: O
the O
role O
of O
critical O
thiol O
groups O
in O
ifosfamide O
nephropathy B
. O

Chloroacetaldehyde O
( O
CAA O
) O
is O
a O
metabolite O
of O
the O
alkylating O
agent O
ifosfamide O
( O
IFO O
) O
and O
putatively O
responsible O
for O
renal B
damage I
following O
anti O
- O
tumor B
therapy O
with O
IFO O
. O

Toxicity B
of O
CAA O
was O
determined O
by O
protein O
content O
, O
cell O
number O
, O
LDH O
release O
, O
trypan O
blue O
exclusion O
assay O
and O
caspase O
- O
3 O
activity O
. O

CAA O
reduced O
hRPTEC O
cell O
number O
and O
protein O
, O
induced O
a O
loss O
in O
free O
intracellular O
thiols O
and O
an O
increase O
in O
necrosis B
markers O
. O

Acidification O
, O
which O
slowed O
the O
reaction O
of O
CAA O
with O
thiol O
donors O
, O
could O
also O
attenuate O
effects O
of O
CAA O
on O
necrosis B
markers O
, O
thiol O
depletion O
and O
cysteine O
protease O
inhibition O
in O
living O
cells O
. O

Thus O
, O
CAA O
directly O
reacts O
with O
cellular O
protein O
and O
non O
- O
protein O
thiols O
, O
mediating O
its O
toxicity B
on O
hRPTEC O
. O

Therefore O
, O
urinary O
acidification O
could O
be O
an O
option O

Following O
status B
epilepticus I
in O
the O
rat O
, O
dentate O
granule O
cell O
neurogenesis O
increases O
greatly O
, O
and O
many O
of O
the O
new O
neurons O
appear O
to O
develop O
ectopically O
, O
in O
the O
hilar O
region O
of O
the O
hippocampal O
formation O
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
ectopic O
hilar O
granule O
cells O
could O
contribute O
to O
the O
spontaneous O
seizures B
that O
ultimately O
develop O
after O

. O

To O
quantify O
this O
population O
, O
the O
total O
number O
of O
ectopic O
hilar O

was O
estimated O
using O
unbiased O
stereology O
at O
different O
times O
after O
pilocarpine O
- O
induced O
status B

. O

The O
results O
indicate O
that O
the O
size O
of O
the O
hilar O
ectopic O
granule O
cell O
population O
after O
status B
epilepticus I
is O
substantial O
, O
and O
stable O
over O
time O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
size O
of O
the O
population O
appears O
to O
be O
correlated O
with O
the O
frequency O
of O
behavioral O
seizures B
, O
because O
animals O
with O
more O
ectopic O
granule O
cells O
in O
the O
hilus O
have O
more O
frequent O
behavioral O
seizures B
. O

The O
results O
provide O
new O
insight O
into O
the O

ectopic O

in O
the O

BACKGROUND O
AND O
AIM O
OF O
THE O
STUDY O
: O
Undersized O

) O
is O
effective O
in O
patients O
with O
dilated B
cardiomyopathy I
and O
functional O
mitral B
regurgitation I
( O
MR B
) O
since O
, O
as O
well O
as O
addressing O
the O
MR B
, O
the O
MAP O
may O
also O
reshape O
the O
dilated O
left O
ventricular O
( O
LV O
) O
base O
. O

However O
, O
the O
direct O
benefits O
of O
this O
possible O
reshaping O
on O
LV O
function O
in O
the O
absence O
of O

The O
study O
aim O
was O
to O
identify O
these O
benefits O
in O
a O
canine O

. O

Acute O
heart B

was O
induced O
by O

; O
an O

were O
acquired O
at O

CONCLUSION O
: O
The O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Renal B

To O

PTRA O
with O
that O
of O

CONCLUSION O
: O
In O
this O
preliminary O

showed O
a O
lower O
susceptibility O

that O
an O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Osteoporosis B

is O
effective O
for O
both O
the O
treatment O
and O

CONCLUSION O
: O
We O
conclude O
that O
patients O
with O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
When O

it O

Our O

those O

at O
the O

would O
benefit O
from O
the O

Metformin O

the O
most O
common O

. O

However O
, O
current O
therapeutic O
interventions O
for O
epilepsy B
can O
also O
cause O
untoward O

Thus O
, O
there O
is O
an O
urgent O
need O
for O
new O
kinds O

both O

This O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
evaluate O
the O

We O
found O
that O
metformin O
suppressed O
the O
progression O
of O
kindling O
, O
ameliorated O
the O
cognitive B
impairment I
and O
decreased O
brain O
oxidative O
stress O
. O

Thus O
the O
present O
study O
concluded O
that O
metformin O
may O
be O
a O
potential O
agent O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
epilepsy B
as O
well O
as O
a O
protective O

However O
, O
no O

on O
the O
role O

In O
this O
study O
, O
we O
explored O
the O
importance O
of O
pathological O
Ca O
( O
2 O

) O
signaling O
in O
aconitine O
poisoning B
in O

and O
in O

. O

We O
found O
that O

lead O
to O
accelerated O

in O
adult O

To O

, O
we O
performed O

The O

showed O
that O

Hence O
, O
our O

that O

UNASSIGNED O
: O
Our O
previous O
study O
has O
indicated O
that O
prenatal O
caffeine O
exposure O
( O
PCE O
) O
could O
induce O
intrauterine B

) O
of O

Recent O
research O
suggested O
that O
IUGR O
is O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
glomerulosclerosis B
. O

However O
, O
whether O
PCE O
could O
induce O
glomerulosclerosis B
and O
its O
underlying O
mechanisms O
remain O
unknown O
. O

This O
study O
aimed O
to O
demonstrate O
the O
induction O
to O
glomerulosclerosis B
in O
adult O
offspring O
by O
PCE O
and O
its O
intrauterine O

mechanisms O
. O

The O
results O
revealed O
that O
the O
adult O
offspring O
kidneys O
in O
the O
PCE O
group O
exhibited O
glomerulosclerosis B

, O
accompanied O
by O
elevated O

These O

that O

DISCUSSION O
: O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Evidence O

An O

This O
is O
inconsistent O
with O
the O
well O

finding O
that O

However O
, O

it O
may O
lead O

Haloperidol O
decreased O
the O

but O
the O
lowering O

Evidence O

Experiments O

previous O
evidence O
that O

that O

induce O

Low O

Thus O
it O

that O
the O

These O

either O
central O
or O

mechanisms O
. O

Phasic O
