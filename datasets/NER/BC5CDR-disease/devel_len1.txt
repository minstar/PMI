BACKGROUND O
: O
Calcitriol O
therapy O
suppresses O
serum O
levels O
of O
parathyroid O
hormone O
( O
PTH O
) O
in O
patients O
with O
renal B
failure I
but O
has O
several O
drawbacks O
, O
including O
hypercalcemia B
and O
/ O
or O
marked O
suppression B
of I
bone I
turnover I
, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
adynamic B
bone I
disease I
. O

These O
effects O
were O
accompanied O
by O
episodes O

hypercalcemia B

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
These O

that O
even O

OCT O
does O
not O
completely O
prevent O
the O
occurrence O
of O
hypercalcemia B
in O

, O
it O
may O
be O
of O
use O
in O
the O
management O
of O
secondary B
hyperparathyroidism I
because O
it O
does O
not O
induce O
low B
bone I
turnover I
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
does O
not O
increase O

CONCLUSION O
: O
We O
suggest O
that O

important O
in O
the O

Dual O
effects O
of O

Melatonin O
affects O
the O
circadian O

, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
whether O
it O
may O
influence O

Melatonin O

however O
, O
no O

. O

In O
particular O
, O
low O
doses O
reduced O
the O
latency O
to O
and O
prolonged O
the O
duration O
of O
barbiturate O
narcosis B
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
highest O
dose O
of O
melatonin O
( O
50 O
mg O
/ O
kg O
) O
caused O
a O
paradoxical O
increase O
in O
the O
latency O
and O
produced O
a O
sustained O
reduction O
of O
the O

of O
narcosis B

and O
a O

Melatonin O

Thus O
, O
the O
dual O
action O

to O
be O
specific O

We O

The O

both O

The O

The O

DISCUSSION O
: O
Although O
there O
is O
increasing O

this O
is O
the O

: O
Dexamethasone O

CASE O
SUMMARY O
: O
A O
76 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
man O
presented O
with O
persistent O
hiccups B
after O
beginning O
azithromycin O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
pharyngitis B
. O

Hiccups B
were O
persistent O
and O
exhausting O
. O

Discontinuation O
of O
azithromycin O
and O
therapy O
with O
baclofen O
finally O
resolved O
hiccups B
. O

No O
organic O
cause O
of O
hiccups B
was O
identified O
despite O
extensive O
investigation O
. O

DISCUSSION O
: O
Pharmacotherapeutic O
agents O
have O
been O
uncommonly O
associated O
with O
hiccups B
. O

Corticosteroids O
( O
dexamethasone O
and O
methylprednisolone O
) O
, O
benzodiazepines O
( O
midazolam O
) O
and O
general O
anaesthesia O
have O
been O
the O
specific O
agents O
mentioned O
most O
frequently O
in O
the O
literature O
as O
being O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
hiccups B
. O

Few O
cases O
of O
drug O
- O
induced O
hiccups B
have O
been O
reported O
related O
to O
macrolide O
antimicrobials O
. O

Using O
the O
Naranjo O
adverse O

reaction O
probability O
scale O
this O
event O
could O
be O
classified O
as O
possible O
( O
score O
5 O
points O
) O
, O
mostly O
because O
of O
the O
close O
temporal O
sequence O
, O
previous O
reports O
on O
this O
reaction O
with O
other O
macrolides O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
alternative O
explanation O
for O
hiccups B
. O

Our O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
a O
vagal O
mechanism O
mediated O
by O
azithromycin O
could O
be O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
hiccups B
in O
our O
patient O
. O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Diagnosis O
of O
drug O
- O
induced O
hiccups B
is O
difficult O
and O
often O
achieved O
only O
by O
a O
process O
of O
elimination O
. O

However O
, O
macrolide O
antimicrobials O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
hiccups B
and O
vagal O
mechanism O
could O
explain O
the O
development O
of O
this O
side O

BACKGROUND O
: O
The O
most O
striking O
of O
carboplatin O
' O
s O
advantages O
( O
CBDCA O
) O
over O
cisplatin O
( O
CDDP O
) O
is O
its O
markedly O
reduced O
rate O
of O
neurotoxic B
effects O
. O

However O
, O
the O
use O

CBDCA O
higher O

intensity O

and O
the O
association O

neurotoxic B

may O
cause O
some O
concern O

its O
safety O
with O

Neurotoxicity B

assessed O

Pain B

were O
significantly O

CBDCA O

neurotoxic B

the O
type O
