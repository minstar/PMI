BACKGROUND O
: O
Calcitriol O
therapy O
suppresses O
serum O
levels O
of O
parathyroid O
hormone O
( O
PTH O
) O
in O
patients O
with O
renal B
failure I
but O
has O
several O
drawbacks O
, O
including O
hypercalcemia B
and O
/ O
or O
marked O
suppression O
of O
bone O
turnover O
, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
adynamic O
bone O
disease O
. O

This O
study O
was O
undertaken O
to O
determine O
the O
effects O
of O
OCT O
on O
serum O
PTH O
levels O
and O
bone O
turnover O
in O
states O
of O
normal O
or O
impaired B
renal I
function I
. O

RESULTS O
: O
In O
Nx O
dogs O
, O
OCT O
significantly O
decreased O
serum O
PTH O
levels O
soon O
after O
the O
induction O
of O
renal B
insufficiency I
. O

These O
effects O
were O
accompanied O
by O
episodes O
of O
hypercalcemia B
and O
hyperphosphatemia B
. O

In O
Nx O
dogs O
, O
OCT O
reversed O
abnormal O
bone O
formation O
, O
such O
as O
woven O
osteoid O
and O
fibrosis B
, O
but O
did O
not O
significantly O
alter O
the O
level O
of O
bone O
turnover O
. O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
even O
though O
OCT O
does O
not O
completely O
prevent O
the O
occurrence O
of O
hypercalcemia B
in O
experimental O
dogs O
with O
renal B
insufficiency I
, O
it O
may O
be O
of O
use O
in O
the O
management O
of O
secondary O
hyperparathyroidism O
because O
it O
does O
not O
induce O
low O
bone O
turnover O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
does O
not O
increase O

Migraine O

thus O
indicating O
that O
migraine O

share O
a O
common O
pathway O
of O
nociception O

In O

suggested O
that O
the O

In O
order O
to O
clarify O
whether O
the O

is O
true O
for O

in O
the O

At O
this O

the O

The O

, O
the O
potential O
of O

apomorphine O
has O
only O

( O

is O
a O
useful O
and O
safe O
provocation O
test O
for O
myocardial B

The O
aim O
of O
the O
present O
study O
is O
to O
examine O
whether O
myocardial B
ischemia I
due O
to O
coronary B

is O
induced O
by O
dobutamine O

All O

pain I
during O
asynergy O
, O
and O
both O
chest B
pain I
and O

changes O
were O
preceded O
by O
asynergy O

These O
findings O
indicate O
that O
dobutamine O
can O
provoke O
coronary B
spasm I
in O
some O
patients O
with O
coronary O

When O

to O
evaluate O
coronary B

disease I
, O
not O
only O
fixed O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Clinicians O
should O
be O

Given O
the O

, O
we O
believe O
that O
this O
case O

an O
example O
of O
metformin O

hepatotoxicity B
, O
the O
first O

We O
compared O
the O
systemic O
toxicity B
of O
bupivacaine O
, O
levobupivacaine O
, O
and O
ropivacaine O
in O
anesthetized O

When O
asystole B
was O
recorded O
, O
drug O
infusion O
was O
stopped O
and O
a O
resuscitation O
sequence O
was O
begun O
. O

The O
cumulative O
doses O
of O
levobupivacaine O
and O
ropivacaine O
that O
produced O
seizures B
were O
similar O
and O
were O
larger O
than O
those O
of O
bupivacaine O
. O

The O
cumulative O
doses O
of O
levobupivacaine O
that O
produced O
dysrhythmias O
and O
asystole B
were O
smaller O
than O
the O
corresponding O
doses O
of O
ropivacaine O
, O
but O
they O
were O
larger O
than O
those O
of O
bupivacaine O
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O
systemic O
toxicity B
of O
levobupivacaine O
is O
intermediate O
between O
that O
of O
ropivacaine O
and O
bupivacaine O
when O
administered O
at O
the O

rate O
and O
that O
ropivacaine O

appears O
to O
be O
more O

CASE O
SUMMARY O
: O
A O
46 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
African O
- O
American O
man O
experienced O
recurrent O
grand O
mal O
seizures O
during O
intravenous O
infusion O
of O
amphotericin O
B O
, O
then O
petit O
mal O
seizures B
as O
the O
infusion O
was O
stopped O
and O
the O
drug O
concentrations O
decreased O
with O
time O
. O

Despite O
administration O
of O
phenytoin O
and O
lorazepam O
, O
the O
seizures B
persisted O
and O
occurred O
only O
during O
amphotercin O
B O
administration O
. O

DISCUSSION O
: O
AIDS B
and O
cryptococcal O
meningitis O
, O
both O
of O
which O
the O
patient O
had O
, O
can O
potentially O
cause O
seizures B
. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
history O
of O
alcohol O
abuse O
; O
alcohol O
intake O
as O
well O
as O
withdrawal O
can O
also O
cause O
seizures B
. O

Didanosine O
also O
has O
a O
potential O
for O
inducing O
seizures B
. O

However O
, O
these O
other O
potential O
causes O
of O
seizure B
were O
ruled O
out O
. O

The O
time O
course O
of O
events O
suggested O
that O
amphotericin O
B O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
seizures B
in O
this O
AIDS B
patient O
. O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Amphotericin O
B O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
probable O
cause O
of O
the O
seizures B
. O

To O
date O
, O
only O
three O
cases O
of O
seizures B
associated O
with O
amphotericin O
B O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
the O
literature O
, O
but O
healthcare O
providers O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
the O
potential O
for O
this O
rare O
adverse O
effect O
. O

Although O
these O
drugs O
are O
highly O
effective O
and O
represent O
the O
mainstay O
of O
transplant O
immunosuppression O
, O
they O
are O
associated O
with O
acute O
and O
chronic O
nephrotoxicity B
. O

Acute O
nephrotoxicity B
, O
which O
occurs O
in O
the O
early O
period O
after O
transplantation O
, O
leads O
to O
a O
higher O
rate O
of O
dialysis O
, O
and O
chronic O
nephrotoxicity B
may O
eventually O
result O
in O
graft O
loss O
. O

Acute O
and O
chronic O
nephrotoxicity B
is O
becoming O
more O
common O
as O
the O
use O
of O
marginal O
kidneys O
for O
transplantation O
increases O
. O

Two O
recently O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Preclinical O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
These O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
for O
viral O
, O

causes O
of O

DISCUSSION O
: O
The O
clinical O
and O
histologic O
picture O
of O
this O
case O
resembles O
halothane B
hepatitis I
, O
which O
has O
a O
significant O
mortality O
rate O
. O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Isoflurane O
, O
a O
common O
anesthetic O
agent O
, O
can O
cause O
severe O
cholestatic B
hepatitis I
. O

There O
is O
a O
growing O
list O
of O
drugs O
implicated O
in O
acquired O

. O

Dopamine O
( O
DA O
) O
, O
through O
D1 O
/ O
D2 O
receptor O
- O
mediated O
signaling O
, O
plays O
a O
major O
role O
in O
the O
control O
of O
epileptic B
seizures I
arising O
in O
the O
limbic O
system O
. O

Excitotoxicity O
leading O
to O
neuronal O
cell O
death O
in O
the O
affected O
areas O
is O
a O
major O
consequence O
of O
seizures B
at O
the O
cellular O
level O
. O

In O
this O
respect O
, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
role O
of O
DA O
receptors O
in O
the O
occurrence O
of O
epilepsy B
- O
induced O
neuronal O
cell O
death O
. O

Here O
we O
analyze O
the O
occurrence O
of O
seizures B
and O
neurotoxicity B
in O
D2R O
- O
/ O
- O
mice O
treated O
with O
the O
cholinergic O
agonist O
pilocarpine O
. O

Importantly O
, O
D2R O
- O
/ O
- O
mice O
develop O
seizures B
at O
doses O
of O
both O
drugs O
that O
are O
not O
epileptogenic O
for O
WT O
littermates O
and O
show O
greater O
neurotoxicity B
. O

However O
, O
pilocarpine O
- O
induced O
seizures B
result O
in O
a O
more O
widespread O
neuronal O
death O
in O
both O
WT O
and O
D2R O
- O
/ O
- O
brains O
in O
comparison O
to O
KA O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
absence O
of O
D2R O
lowers O
the O
threshold O
for O
seizures B
induced O
by O
both O
glutamate O
and O
acetylcholine O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
dopaminergic O
control O
of O
epilepsy B
- O
induced O
neurodegeneration B
seems O
to O
be O
mediated O
by O
distinct O
interactions O
of O
D2R O
signaling O
with O
these O
two O
neurotransmitters O
. O

Steroid O
structure O
and O
pharmacological O
properties O
determine O
the O
anti O
- O
amnesic B
effects O
of O
pregnenolone O
sulphate O
in O
the O
passive O
avoidance O
task O
in O
rats O
. O

Moreover O
, O
PREGS O
is O
able O
to O
reverse O
the O
amnesic B
- O
like O
effects O
of O
NMDAR O
and O
GABA O
( O
A O
) O
R O
ligands O
. O

The O
memory O
- O
enhancing O
effects O
of O
PREGS O
and O
its O
analogs O
were O
tested O
in O
the O
passive O
avoidance O
task O
using O
the O
model O
of O
scopolamine O
- O
induced O
amnesia B
. O

Moreover O
, O
enantioselectivity O
was O
demonstrated O
by O
the O
ability O
of O
natural O
PREGS O
to O
be O
an O
order O
of O
magnitude O
more O
effective O
than O
its O
synthetic O
enantiomer O
in O
reversing O
scopolamine O
- O
induced O
amnesia B
. O

Activation O
of O
poly O
( O
ADP O
- O
ribose O
) O
polymerase O
contributes O
to O
development O
of O
doxorubicin O
- O
induced O
heart B
failure I
. O

Increased O
oxidative O
stress O
is O
a O
major O
factor O
implicated O
in O
the O
cardiotoxicity B
of O
doxorubicin O
( O
DOX O
) O
, O
a O
widely O
used O
antitumor O
anthracycline O
antibiotic O
. O

Thus O
, O
we O
hypothesized O
that O
the O
activation O
of O
PARP O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
DOX O
- O
induced O
cardiotoxicity B
. O

Using O
a O
dual O
approach O
of O
PARP O
- O
1 O
suppression O
, O
by O
genetic O
deletion O
or O
pharmacological O
inhibition O
with O
the O
phenanthridinone O
PARP O
inhibitor O
PJ34 O
, O
we O
now O
demonstrate O
the O
role O
of O
PARP O
in O
the O
development O
of O
cardiac B
dysfunction I
induced O
by O
DOX O
. O

Treatment O
with O
a O
PJ34 O
significantly O
improved O
cardiac B
dysfunction I
and O
increased O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
animals O
. O

Thus O
, O
PARP O
activation O
contributes O
to O
the O
cardiotoxicity B
of O
DOX O
. O

SUMMARY O
: O
A O
41 O

of O
hyperthyroidism B
had O
been O
treated O
with O
carbimazole O
and O
propranolol O
for O
the O
past O
5 O
years O
. O

He O
developed O
acute B
liver I
failure I
with O
rapid O
deterioration O
of O
renal O
function O
. O

His O
condition O
was O
further O
complicated O
by O
sepsis B
and O
coagulopathy B
. O

The O
likelihood O
that O
bupropion O
induced O
hepatotoxicity B
in O
our O
patient O
was O
possible O
, O
based O
on O
the O

DISCUSSION O
: O
Although O
there O
is O
increasing O
evidence O
of O
hepatotoxicity B
induced O
by O
bupropion O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
case O

that O
could O
have O
resulted O
from O
acute B
liver I

in O
a O
patient O
receiving O
bupropion O
while O

We O
report O

the O

in O
a O

for O
a O
57 O

- O
old O
woman O
with O
severe O
chloroquine O
- O
induced O
myopathy B
. O

Since O
1989 O
, O
she O
had O
been O
suffering O
from O
systemic B
lupus I

( O
SLE O
) O
with O
renal O

and O
undergone O
periods O
of O

with O
azathioprine O
and O

. O

Thus O
, O
muscle O

of O
the O
deltoid O

was O
performed O
in O
order O
to O
exclude O
polymyositis O
or O

describes O
a O
generalized O

associated O
with O
sustained O

release O
bupropion O
use O
and O
sleep O

. O

After O
5 O
weeks O
of O
bupropion O
use O
, O
the O
subject O
experienced O
a O
generalized O

seizure B
after O
staying O
up O
nearly O
all O

packing O
and O
moving O
to O
a O

. O

The O
patient O
had O
no O
other O

for O
seizures B

We O
suggest O
that O
sleep O

may O
add O
to O
the O

. O

The O
pathogenesis O
of O
this O
myalgia B
is O
still O

We O
designed O
the O
present O

to O
investigate O
whether O
an O

to O
this O
myalgia B

The O
incidence O

Incidence O

did O
not O
differ O

was O
reported O
by O
five O
patients O
and O
three O

, O
respectively O
( O

At O
48 O

in O
both O

suffered O
from O

In O

, O
interleukin O

as O
an O

was O
assessed O
in O
a O
subgroup O

10 O
patients O
pretreated O

. O

We O
found O
an O
increase O
of O
IL O

for O
only O
three O
patients O
, O
but O
only O
one O

; O
no O

between O
myalgia B

the O

. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there O
is O
no O

for O
an O

Furthermore O

With O

we O
were O
able O
to O
identify O

CASE O
SUMMARY O
: O
A O
76 O
- O

old O
man O
presented O
with O
persistent O
hiccups B
after O
beginning O
azithromycin O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
pharyngitis O
. O

Hiccups B
were O
persistent O
and O
exhausting O
. O

Discontinuation O
of O
azithromycin O
and O
therapy O
with O
baclofen O
finally O
resolved O
hiccups B
. O

No O
organic O
cause O
of O
hiccups B
was O
identified O
despite O
extensive O
investigation O
. O

DISCUSSION O
: O
Pharmacotherapeutic O
agents O
have O
been O
uncommonly O
associated O
with O
hiccups B
. O

Corticosteroids O
( O
dexamethasone O
and O
methylprednisolone O
) O
, O
benzodiazepines O
( O
midazolam O
) O
and O
general O
anaesthesia O
have O
been O
the O
specific O
agents O
mentioned O
most O
frequently O
in O
the O
literature O
as O
being O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
hiccups B
. O

Few O
cases O
of O
drug O
- O
induced O
hiccups B
have O
been O
reported O
related O
to O
macrolide O
antimicrobials O
. O

Using O
the O

reaction O
probability O
scale O
this O
event O
could O
be O
classified O
as O
possible O
( O
score O
5 O
points O
) O
, O
mostly O
because O
of O
the O
close O
temporal O
sequence O
, O
previous O
reports O
on O
this O
reaction O
with O
other O
macrolides O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
alternative O
explanation O
for O
hiccups B
. O

Our O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
a O
vagal O
mechanism O
mediated O
by O
azithromycin O
could O
be O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
hiccups B
in O
our O
patient O
. O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Diagnosis O
of O
drug O
- O
induced O
hiccups B
is O
difficult O
and O
often O
achieved O
only O
by O
a O
process O
of O
elimination O
. O

However O
, O
macrolide O
antimicrobials O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
hiccups B
and O
vagal O
mechanism O
could O
explain O

CONCLUSION O
: O
Milk O

The O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
This O
work O
clearly O
indicates O
a O
protective O
role O
of O
Nrf2 O
in O
diabetic B
nephropathy I
, O
suggesting O
that O
dietary O

could O
be O
used O
as O
a O
strategy O
to O
prevent O
or O
slow O
down O
the O
progression O
of O
diabetic B
nephropathy I

Metformin O
prevents O
experimental O
gentamicin O

induced O
nephropathy B

Here O
we O
tested O
whether O
it O
has O
a O
beneficial O
effect O
in O
a O

Metformin O
treatment O
fully O
blocked O

Thus O
, O
our O
study O
suggests O
that O
pleiotropic O
effects O
of O
metformin O
can O
lessen O
gentamicin O
nephrotoxicity B
and O
improve O

because O

Here O

that O

for O
the O
development O
of O

None O

Based O
on O
the O

we O
suggest O
that O

develop O

A O
discussion O
of O
the O
history O

the O

Despite O
the O

, O
ergot O
preparations O
continue O

that O
the O

showed O
a O
significant O
decrease O
of O
chronic O
nephrotoxicity B
secondary O
to O

term O
therapy O
with O
cyclosporine O
. O

We O
think O
that O
even O
these O
lower O
dosages O
of O
cyclosporine O
can O
cause O
chronic O
nephrotoxicity B
and O
that O
further O
modification O
of O
the O
immunosuppressive O
regimen O
is O
required O
to O
completely O
abolish O
this O
toxic O
side O
effect O

Ethopropazine O

In O
a O
12 O

study O
ethopropazine O
was O
compared O
to O
benztropine O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
parkinsonism B
induced O
by O
fluphenazine O
enanthate O
in O
60 O
schizophrenic B
outpatients O
. O

Ethopropazine O
and O
benztropine O
were O
found O
to O
be O
equally O
effective O
in O
controlling O
parkinsonian B
symptoms I
and O
were O
as O
efficacious O
as O
procyclidine O
, O
their O
previous O
antiparkinsonian O
drug O
. O

However O
, O
benztropine O
treated O
patients O
had O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
tardive B
dyskinesia I
compared O
to O
their O
condition O
during O
procyclindine O
treatment O
, O
and O
significantly O
more O
anxiety B
and O
depression B
than O
ethopropazine O
treated O
patients O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
benztropine O
is O
not O
the O
anticholinergic O
drug O
of O
choice O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
neuroleptic O
- O
induced O
parkinsonian B
symptoms I
, O
because O
of O
its O
more O
toxic O
central O

peripheral O
atropinic O

Objective O

were O
compared O
during O

Both O
epinephrine O
and O
exercise O
produced O
myocardial B

as O
evidenced O
by O

angina B
. O

However O
, O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
myocardial B

by O
epinephrine O
were O
significantly O
different O
from O
those O
of O

marked O
predominantly O
by O

with O
a O
minor O
contribution O

while O
epinephrine O

ischemia B
was O
characterized O
by O
a O

a O
less O
pronounced O
increase O
in O
heart O
rate O
and O

These O

indicate O
that O
ischemia B

epinephrine O
, O
as O
may O
occur O
during O
states O
of O
emotional O

has O
a O

be O
considered O
along O

The O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Hallucinations B
as O
a O
symptom O
of O
central O
neurotoxicity B
are O
a O
known O

side O
effect O

have O
been O
reported O

METHODS O
: O
The O
authors O

six O
persons O
with O
ifosfamide O

induced O
hallucinations B
in O
the O
presence O
of O

RESULTS O
: O
Hallucinations B
occurred O
only O

, O
in O
all O

were O
reported O
as O
disturbing O
or O
frightening O
. O

Underreporting O
of O
these O
hallucinations B
by O

is O
likely O
. O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Hallucinations B
may O
be O
the O
sole O
or O
first O
manifestation O
of O
neurotoxicity B
. O

The O
clinician O
should O
be O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Tamoxifen O
is O
a O
candidate O
chemopreventive O
agent O
in O
breast B
cancer I
, O
although O
the O
drug O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
endometrial B
cancer I
. O

METHODS O
: O
In O
October O
, O
1992 O
, O
we O
started O
a O
double O
- O
blind O
placebo O
- O
controlled O
, O
randomised O
trial O
of O
tamoxifen O
in O
women O
( O
mainly O
in O
Italy O
) O
who O
did O
not O
have O
breast B
cancer I
and O
who O
had O
had O
a O
hysterectomy O
. O

The O
primary O
endpoints O
are O
the O
occurrence O
of O
and O
deaths O
from O
breast B
cancer I
. O

41 O
cases O
of O
breast B
cancer I
occurred O
so O
far O
; O
there O
have O
been O
no O
deaths O
from O
breast B
cancer I
. O

There O
is O
no O
difference O
in O
breast B

cancer I
frequency O
between O
the O
placebo O
( O
22 O
cases O
) O
and O

. O

There O
is O
a O
statistically O
significant O
reduction O
of O
breast B
cancer I
among O
women O
receiving O
tamoxifen O
who O
also O
used O
hormone O

therapy O
during O
the O
trial O
: O
among O
390 O
women O
on O
such O
therapy O
and O
allocated O
to O
placebo O
, O
we O
found O
eight O
cases O
of O

cancer I
compared O
with O
one O
case O
among O
362 O
women O
allocated O
to O
tamoxifen O

INTERPRETATION O
: O
Although O
