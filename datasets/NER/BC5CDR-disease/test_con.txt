We O
give O
a O
brief O
overview O
of O
ion B
channel I
disorders I
including O
malignant B
hyperthermia I
and O
their O
anaesthetic O
considerations O
. O

METHODS O
: O
Twelve O
rats O
( O
six O
chronically O
epileptic O
animals O
and O
six O
controls O
) O
were O
anesthetized O
, O
given O
tracheotomies O
, O
and O
subjected O
to O
hyperventilation B
or O
hypoventilation O
conditions O
. O

RESULTS O
: O
The O
hyperventilation B
maneuver O
caused O
a O
decrease O
in O
spontaneous O
ventilation O
in O
pilocarpine O
- O
treated O
and O
control O
rats O
. O

Vincristine O
was O
accidentally O
given O
intrathecally O
to O
a O
child O
with O
leukaemia O
, O
producing O
sensory B
and I
motor I
dysfunction I
followed O
by O
encephalopathy O
and O
death O
. O

Ocular O
motility O
changes O
after O
subtenon O
carboplatin O
chemotherapy O
for O
retinoblastoma B
. O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Focal O
subtenon O
carboplatin O
injections O
have O
recently O
been O
used O
as O
a O
presumably O
toxicity O
- O
free O
adjunct O
to O
systemic O
chemotherapy O
for O
intraocular O
retinoblastoma B
. O

METHODS O
: O
We O
noted O
abnormal O
ocular O
motility O
in O
10 O
consecutive O
patients O
with O
retinoblastoma B
who O
had O
received O
subtenon O
carboplatin O
. O

RESULTS O
: O
Limitation O
of O
ocular O
motility O
was O
detected O
in O
all O
12 O
eyes O
of O
10 O
patients O
treated O
for O
intraocular O
retinoblastoma B
with O
1 O
to O
6 O
injections O
of O
subtenon O
carboplatin O
as O
part O
of O
multimodality O
therapy O
. O

The O
enucleations O
were O
technically O
difficult O
and O
hazardous O
for O
globe O
rupture B
because O
of O
extensive O
orbital O
soft O
tissue O
adhesions O
. O

METHOD O
: O
Thirteen O
patients O
who O
developed O
optic O
neuropathy O
after O
being O
treated O
with O
ethambutol O
for O
tuberculosis B
of I
the I
lung I
or I
lymph I
node I
at O
Siriraj O
Hospital O
between O
1997 O
and O
2001 O
were O
retrospectively O
reviewed O
. O

Treatment O
of O
compensatory O
gustatory B
hyperhidrosis I
with O
topical O
glycopyrrolate O
. O

Gustatory B
hyperhidrosis I
is O
facial O
sweating B
usually O
associated O
with O
the O
eating O
of O
hot O
spicy O
food O
or O
even O
smelling O
this O
food O
. O

All O
patients O
had O
gustatory B
hyperhidrosis I
, O
which O
interfered O
with O
their O
social O
activities O
, O
after O
transthroacic O
endoscopic O
sympathectomy O
, O
and O
which O
was O
associated O
with O
compensatory O
focal O
hyperhidrosis O
. O

After O
applying O
topical O
glycopyrrolate O
, O
the O
subjective O
effect O
was O
excellent O
( O
no O
sweating B
after O
eating O
hot O
spicy O
food O
) O
in O
10 O
patients O
( O
77 O
% O
) O
, O
and O
fair O
( O
clearly O
reduced O
sweating B
) O
in O
3 O
patients O
( O
23 O
% O
) O
. O

Adverse O
effects O
included O
a O
mildly O
dry O
mouth O
and O
a O
sore B
throat I
in O
2 O
patients O
( O
2 O
% O
glycopyrrolate O
) O
, O
a O
light O
headache O
in O
1 O
patient O
( O
1 O
. O
5 O
% O
glycopyrrolate O
) O
. O

The O
topical O
application O
of O
a O
glycopyrrolate O
pad O
appeared O
to O
be O
safe O
, O
efficacious O
, O
well O
tolerated O
, O
and O
a O
convenient O
method O
of O
treatment O
for O
moderate O
to O
severe O
symptoms O
of O
gustatory B
hyperhidrosis I
in O
post O
transthoracic O
endoscopic O
sympathectomy O
or O
sympathicotomy O
patients O
, O
with O
few O
side O
effects O
. O

Six O
stable O
psychiatric O
outpatients O
with O
hyperprolactinemia O
and O
amenorrhea O
/ O
oligomenorrhea B
associated O
with O
their O
neuroleptic O
medications O
were O
treated O
with O
bromocriptine O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
bromocriptine O
should O
be O
further O
evaluated O
as O
potential O
therapy O
for O
neuroleptic O
- O
associated O
hyperprolactinemia O
and O
amenorrhea O
/ O
galactorrhea B
. O

The O
main O
side O
- O
effects O
were O
headache O
, O
dizziness O
, O
palpitation B
and O
flushing O
and O
these O
were O
not O
more O
frequent O
than O
reported O
in O
other O
studies O
with O
isradipine O
or O
with O
placebo O
. O

Owing O
to O
a O
high O
incidence O
of O
thrombophlebitis B
, O
the O
study O
was O
terminated O
prematurely O
and O
only O
the O
data O
of O
the O
two O
parallel O
treatment O
groups O
( O
15 O
patients O
in O
each O
group O
) O
were O
analysed O

Although O
both O

had O
similar O
pharmacokinetic O
and O
pharmacodynamic O
profiles O
the O
new O
formulation O
is O
not O
suitable O
for O

use O
due O
to O
the O
high O

of O

In O
this O

the O
occurrence O
of O

Induction O
of O
rosaceiform O

during O
treatment O
of O
facial B
inflammatory I
dermatoses I
with O
tacrolimus O
ointment O
. O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Tacrolimus O
ointment O
is O
increasingly O
used O
for O
anti O
- O
inflammatory O
treatment O
of O
sensitive O
areas O
such O
as O
the O
face O
, O
and O
recent O
observations O
indicate O
that O
the O
treatment O
is O
effective O
in O
steroid O
- O
aggravated O
rosacea B
and O
perioral B
dermatitis I
. O

OBSERVATIONS O
: O
Six O
adult O
patients O
with O
inflammatory B
facial I
dermatoses I
were O
treated O
with O
tacrolimus O
ointment O
because O
of O
the O
ineffectiveness O
of O
standard O
treatments O
. O

Within O
2 O
to O
3 O
weeks O
of O
initially O
effective O
and O
well O

tolerated O
treatment O
, O
3 O
patients O
with O
a O
history O
of O
rosacea B
and O
1 O
with O
a O
history O
of O
acne O
experienced O
sudden O
worsening O
with O
pustular O
rosaceiform O
lesions O
. O

In O
1 O
patient O
with O
eyelid O
eczema B
, O
rosaceiform O
periocular B
dermatitis I
gradually O
appeared O
after O
3 O
weeks O
of O
treatment O
. O

In O
1 O
patient O
with O
atopic B
dermatitis I
, O
telangiectatic O
and O
papular B
rosacea I
insidiously O
appeared O
after O
5 O
months O
of O
treatment O
. O

Prominent O

result O
from O

Niacin O

/ O
lovastatin O
is O
a O
new O
combination O
product O
approved O
for O
treatment O
of O
primary O
hypercholesterolemia O
and O
mixed O
dyslipidemia B
. O

A O
total O
of O
4 O
, O
499 O
patients O
with O
dyslipidemia B
requiring O
drug O
intervention O
was O
enrolled O
at O
1 O
, O
081 O
sites O
. O

Patients O
also O
received O
dietary O
counseling O
, O
educational O
materials O
, O
and O
reminders O
to O
call O
a O
toll O
- O
free O

that O
provided O

about O

and O

The O
case O
discussed O
herein O
initially O
appeared O
to O
be O
neurogenic B
diabetes I
insipidus I
( O
DI O
) O
secondary O
to O
a O
traumatic O
brain O
injury O
. O

Lithium O
is O
implicated O
in O
drug O
- O
induced O
nephrogenic B
DI I
, O
and O
because O
the O
patient O
had O
not O
received O
lithium O
since O
being O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O
his O
treatment O
changed O
to O
focus O
on O
nephrogenic B
DI I
. O

By O
combining O
information O
from O
the O
patient O
history O
, O
the O
physical O
examination O
, O
and O
radiologic O
and O
laboratory O
studies O
, O
the O
critical O
care O
team O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
self O
- O
treating O
his O
lithium O
- O
induced O
nephrogenic B
DI I
and O
developed O
neurogenic B
DI I
secondary O
to O
brain O
trauma O
. O

Thus O
successful O
treatment O
required O
that O
nephrogenic O
and O
neurogenic B
DI I
be O
treated O
concomitantly O
. O

Patients O
were O
asked O
about O
dysphagia B
and O
evaluated O
with O
the O
Unified O
Parkinson O

Disease O
Rating O
Scale O
Parts O
II O

III O
and O
the O

Neither O
the O

of O
dysphagia B
nor O
any O
of O
the O
PD O
severity O
parameters O
correlated O
to O
the O
videofluoroscopic O
variables O
. O

Our O
results O
suggest O
a O
role O
for O
levodopa O
in O
the O
oral O
phase O
of O
deglutition O
and O
confirm O
that O
dysphagia B
is O
not O
a O
good O
predictor O
of O

alterations O
in O

Our O

However O

should O
be O

the O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Lamivudine O
is O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
chronic B

Recent O

show O
that O
the O

occur O
as O
natural O
genome O

in O

In O
this O
study O
we O

to O
determine O
the O

The O
lung B
mass I
was O
highly O
suspected O
to O
be O
lung B
cancer I
on O
CT O

positron O

histologically O
the O

was O
composed O

alveolar O

and O
intra O

alveolar O
accumulation O
of O
foamy O
macrophages O

that O
it O
was O
an O

In O

, O
the O
lung O

in O
the O

The O

the O
possibility O
that O
differential O
diagnosis O
between O
an O

can O
be O
very O

that O

be O
another O

we O

that O

Hypertension O
