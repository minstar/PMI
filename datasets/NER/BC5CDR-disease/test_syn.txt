CONCLUSION O

Our O

CONCLUSION O
: O

In O

Even O
if O

: O
Of O
29 O

CONCLUSION O
: O
Despite O
theoretical O
concerns O
that O
lidocaine O
may O
enhance O
cocaine O
toxicity O
, O
the O
use O
of O
lidocaine O
in O
patients O
with O
cocaine O
- O
associated O
MI B
was O
not O
associated O
with O
significant O
cardiovascular O
or O
central O
nervous O
system O
toxicity O
. O

It O
is O
thus O
confirmed O
that O
the O
histological O
characteristics O
of O
myopathic B
rat O
muscle O
induced O
experimentally O
are O
extraordinarily O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
human O
myopathy O
as O
confirmed O
during O
biopsies O
performed O
at O
the O
Orthopaedic O
Traumatological O
Centre O
, O
Florence O
. O

The O
encouraging O
results O
obtained O
in O
various O
authoratative O
departments O
in O
myopathic B
patients O
by O
using O
anabolizing O
steroids O
have O
encouraged O
the O
authors O
to O
investigate O
the O
beneficial O
effects O
of O
one O
anabolizing O
agent O
( O
Dianabol O
, O
CIBA O
) O
at O
high O
doses O
in O
rats O
rendered O
myopathic B
by O
a O
diet O
deficient O
in O
vitamin O
E O
. O

In O
this O
way O
they O
obtained O
appreciable O
changes O
in O
body O
weight O
( O
increased O
from O
50 O
to O
70 O
g O
after O
forty O
days O
at O
a O
dose O
of O
5 O
mg O
per O
day O
of O
anabolizing O
agent O
) O
, O
but O
most O
of O
all O
they O
found O
histological O
changes O
due O
to O
" O
regenerative O
" O
changes O
in O
the O
muscle O
tissue O
, O
which O
however O
maintained O
its O
myopathic B
characteristics O
in O
the O
control O
animals O
that O
were O
not O
treated O
with O
the O
anabolizing O
agent O
. O

The O
authors O
conclude O
by O
affirming O
the O
undoubted O
efficacy O
of O
the O
anabolizing O
steroids O
in O
experimental O
myopathic B
disease I
, O
but O
they O
have O
reservations O
as O
to O
the O
transfer O
of O
the O
results O
into O
the O
human O
field O
, O
where O
high O
dosage O
cannot O
be O
carried O
out O
continuously O
because O
of O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
drug O
on O
virility O
; O
because O
the O
tissue O
injury O
too O
often O
occurs O
at O
an O
irreversible O
stage O
vis O
- O
a O
- O
vis O
the O
" O
regeneration O
" O
of O
the O
muscle O
tissue O
; O
and O
finally O
because O
the O
dystrophic O
injurious O
agent O
is O
certainly O
not O
the O
lack O
of O
vitamin O
E O
but O
something O
as O
yet O
unknown O
