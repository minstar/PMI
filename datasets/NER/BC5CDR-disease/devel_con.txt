OBJECTIVE O

We O

METHODS O
: O
We O

DISCUSSION O
: O
Our O

Although O

not O
effective O
for O
all O
children O

in O
this O

of O
those O

: O
Two O

Arteritis B

These O

that O

The O
etiology O
of O
pyeloureteritis B

has O
long O
been O
attributed O
to O
chronic O
infection O

. O

The O

The O

Thus O
, O

induced O
symptoms O
of O
pheochromocytoma B

We O

All O
4 O

our O

that O

: O
The O

65 O
women O

20 O
without O

who O

parameters O
in O

RESULTS O
: O
Urinary O
NGF O
, O
PGE2 O

were O
significantly O
increased O
in O

However O
, O
urinary O
PGI2 O
was O
not O

In O
patients O

urinary O
PGE2 O

did O
not O
correlate O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
NGF O
and O
PGs O
have O
important O
roles O
in O
the O
development O
of O
OAB B
symptoms O
in O
female O
patients O

The O
current O
best O
treatment O
for O
HCV B
infection I
is O
combination O
therapy O
with O
pegylated O
interferon O
and O
ribavirin O
. O

Hemoglobin O
concentrations O
decrease O
mainly O
as O
a O
result O
of O
ribavirin O
- O
induced O
hemolysis O
, O
and O
this O
anemia O
can O
be O
problematic O
in O
patients O
with O
HCV B
infection I
, O
especially O
those O
who O
have O
comorbid O
renal B
or I
cardiovascular I
disorders I

This O
study O
examined O
the O
utility O

Possible O
neuroleptic B
malignant I

related O
to O

This O
patient O
presented O
with O
symptoms O
of O
neuroleptic B
malignant I
syndrome I
( O
NMS B
) O
, O
thus O
demonstrating O
that O
NMS B
- O
like O
symptoms O
can O
occur O
after O
combined O
paroxetine O
and O
alprazolam O
treatment O
. O

The O

obtained O
by O
the O

and O
the O

used O
in O
this O
case O
. O

Several O
risk O
factors O
for O
NMS B
should O
be O
noted O
in O
elderly O

patients O
whose O
symptoms O
often O
include O
dehydration O
, O
agitation O
, O
malnutrition O
, O
and O
exhaustion O
. O

This O
neuropathy O
was O
gradually O
resolving O
; O
however O
, O
after O
the O
patient O
received O
allogeneic O
bone O
marrow O
transplantation O
, O
the O
symptoms O
worsened O
, O
with O
the O
development O
of O
graft B

, O
and O
the O
symptoms O
subsequently O
responded O
to O
methylprednisolone O

AIM O
: O
Widespread O
use O
of O
mannitol O
to O
reduce O
brain O

in O
brain B
tumor I

by O
the O

. O

As O
a O
contribution O
to O
this O
issue O
we O
decided O
to O
research O
the O
possible O
passage O
of O
mannitol O
into O
the O
brain O
after O
administration O
to O

underwent O
hip B

The O

CONCLUSION O
: O
The O

However O
, O

OBJECTIVE O

The O

this O

was O
to O
investigate O
whether O
