OBJECTIVES O
: O
The O
aim O
of O
this O

was O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
use O
of O
amiodarone O
in O
patients O

increases O
the O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Reports O

are O
infrequent O
and O

to O
studies O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Indomethacin O
resulted O
in O
histopathologic O
findings O
typical O
of O
interstitial B
cystitis I
, O
such O
as O
leaky O

The O
antiangiogenic O

have O
been O
assessed O
in O
clinical O
trials O
in O
patients O
with O
various O
solid O

We O
undertook O
an O

using O
thalidomide O
100 O

daily O
for O
up O
to O
6 O
months O
in O
20 O
men O
with O

In O
the O
seven O
men O
who O
completed O
six O
months O
on O
thalidomide O
, O
subclinical O
evidence O
of O
peripheral B

was O
found O
in O
four O
before O
treatment O
, O
but O
in O
all O
seven O
at O
repeat O

. O

The O
findings O
indicate O
that O
thalidomide O
may O
be O
an O
option O
for O
patients O
who O
have O
failed O
other O
forms O
of O

provided O

Neither O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Although O
levobupivacaine O
may O
have O
a O
safer O
cardiac B

profile O
than O
racemic O
bupivacaine O
, O

STUDY O
: O
Undersized O
mitral O
annuloplasty O
( O
MAP O
) O
is O
effective O
in O
patients O
with O
dilated B
cardiomyopathy I
and O
functional O
mitral B
regurgitation I
( O
MR B
) O
since O
, O
as O
well O
as O
addressing O
the O
MR B
, O
the O
MAP O
may O
also O
reshape O
the O
dilated O
left O

( O
LV O
) O
base O
. O

The O
study O
aim O
was O
to O
identify O
these O
benefits O
in O
a O
canine O
model O
of O
acute O
heart B
failure I
. O

Acute O
heart B
failure I
was O
induced O
by O
propranolol O
and O
volume O

after O
weaning O
from O
cardiopulmonary O
bypass O
; O
an O
absence O
of O
MR B
was O
confirmed O
by O

. O

Data O
were O
acquired O
at O
baseline O
, O
after O
induction O
of O
acute O
heart B

, O
and O
after O

CONCLUSION O
: O
The O
data O
acquired O
suggest O
that O
isolated O
MAP O
may O
have O
certain O
benefits O
on O
LV O
dimension O

in O
acute O

, O
even O
in O
the O

However O
, O
further O
investigations O
are O
warranted O
in O
