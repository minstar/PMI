BACKGROUND O
: O
Calcitriol O
therapy O
suppresses O
serum O
levels O
of O
parathyroid O
hormone O
( O
PTH O
) O
in O
patients O

several O
drawbacks O
, O
including O
hypercalcemia O

or O
marked O
suppression B
of I
bone I
turnover I
, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
These O

that O
even O

prevent O
the O
occurrence O

, O
it O
may O
be O
of O
use O
in O
the O
management O
of O
secondary O
hyperparathyroidism O
because O
it O
does O
not O
induce O
low B
bone I
turnover I
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
does O
not O
increase O
the O

BACKGROUND O
: O

Because O

Migraine O

indicating O
that O

The O

Until O

the O

the O

We O

All O

Coronary O

was O

by O

and O
no O
fixed O
coronary B

was O
documented O
on O

These O

indicate O
that O

provoke O
coronary O

in O
some O

When O

not O

Melatonin O
affects O
the O
circadian O

cycle O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
whether O
it O

Melatonin O
pre O

treatment O
affected O
in O
a O
dual O
manner O
barbiturate O
narcosis B
, O
however O
, O
no O

was O
found O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
low O
doses O
reduced O
the O
latency O

and O
prolonged O
the O
duration O
of O
barbiturate O
narcosis B
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
highest O
dose O
of O
melatonin O
( O
50 O
mg O

kg O
) O
caused O
a O
paradoxical O
increase O
in O
the O

produced O
a O
sustained O

Thus O
, O
the O
dual O
action O

The O

A O
serious O

is O
an O
optic B

that O
impairs O
visual O
acuity O

, O
and O

However O
, O
early O

, O

the O

mild O

the O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
The O
OCT O
results O
in O
these O
patients O
with O
EMB O
- O
induced O
optic B

show O
considerable O
loss O
especially O
of O
the O
temporal O

. O

This O
is O
consistent O
with O
prior O
histopathological O
studies O
that O
show O
predominant O
loss O
of O
parvo O

cellular O
axons O

) O
within O
the O

in O

OCT O
can O
be O
a O
valuable O
tool O
in O
the O
quantitative O

of O
optic B

Additionally O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
management O
of O
EMB O

, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
properly O
manage O

and O
to O
achieve O
proper O

Hypoxia O
in O

We O
then O
applied O
this O
animal O
model O
to O
the O
detection O
of O

in O

Finally O

we O

We O
propose O
here O
a O
possible O

between O

It O
has O
been O
previously O
shown O
that O
myocardial O
contrast O

is O
a O
valuable O
technique O
for O
delineating O
regions O
of O
myocardial O

secondary O
to O
coronary O
occlusion O
and O
to O
critical O
coronary B
stenoses I
in O
the O
presence O
of O
hyperemic B
stimulation O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
whether O
myocardial O
contrast O
echocardiography O
performed O
with O
a O
stable O
solution O
of O
sonicated O
albumin O
could O
detect O
regions O
of O
myocardial O
underperfusion O
resulting O
from O
various O
degrees O
of O
coronary B
stenosis I
. O

During O
dipyridamole O
- O
induced O
hyperemia O
, O
12 O
of O
the O
16 O
dogs O
with O
a O
partial O
coronary B
stenosis I
had O
a O
visible O
area O
of O
hypoperfusion O
by O
contrast O

. O

Thus O
, O
myocardial O
contrast O

can O
be O
used O
to O
visualize O
and O
quantitate O
the O
amount O
of O
jeopardized O

during O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Pemoline O

an O

from O

used O
in O

literature O
as O
a O
cause O

The O
following O
case O
describes O
two O

who O
experienced O

The O

had O
a O
medical O
history O
significant O
for O

previously O

without O
success O
. O

The O
choreoathetoid B
movements O
began O
45 O
min O

The O
children O
gave O
no O
history O
of O
prior O
movement B

and O
there O
was O
no O

The O
children O
received O
gastrointestinal O

and O
high O
doses O
of O

benzodiazepines O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
control O
the O
choreoathetoid B

. O

Despite O
treatment O
, O
the O
children O
continued O
to O
have O
choreoathetosis B
for O
approximately O
24 O
hours O
. O

The O
possibility O
of O
choreoathetoid B

should O
be O
considered O
in O
patients O

OBJECTIVE O
: O
To O
determine O
the O
risk O
for O
new O
or O
worsening O
valvular B
abnormalities I
among O
users O
of O
fenfluramine O
or O
dexfenfluramine O
who O
underwent O
echocardiography O
before O
they O
began O
to O
take O
these O
medications O
. O

The O
primary O
outcome O
was O
new O
or O
worsening O
valvulopathy B
, O
defined O
as O
progression O
of O
either O
aortic O
or O
mitral O
regurgitation O
by O
at O
least O
one O
degree O
of O
severity O
and O

The O

In O
TD O
group O
, O
three O
patients O
developed O
decreased B

with O
an O

whereas O
in O
the O
OD O
group O
only O
one O
patient O
presented O
decreased B

The O
use O
of O
adriamycin O
( O
ADR O
) O
in O
cancer O
chemotherapy O
has O
been O
limited O
due O
to O
its O
cumulative O
cardiovascular B
toxicity I
. O

Our O
results O
indicated O
that O

characterized O
by O

Knowing O
that O
heart O

represent O
almost O
40 O

, O
we O
conclude O
that O
the O
deteriorating O
effects O
of O
ADR O
on O
cardiovascular O
function O
involve O
mitochondrial B
structural I
and I
functional I
impairment I
