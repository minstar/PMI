The O
first O
recorded O
bout O
of O
illness O
suffered O
by O
the O
marquis O
, O
then O
Lord O
Higham O
, O
was O
in O
July O
1741 O
when O
the O
11 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
was O
" O
a O
little O
indisposed O
, O
something O
Feaverish O
I O
guess O
it O
proceeds O
from O
Worms O
and O
will O
Soon O
be O
removed O
" O
. O
3 O
He O
also O
had O
a O
rash O
and O
it O
was O
thought O
that O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
problem O
was O
that O
the O
boy B
had O
overheated O
himself O
. O
4 O
He O
was O
still O
ill O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
August O
: O
he O
had O
been O
" O
much O
out O
of O
order O
" O
for O
a O
long O
time O
but O
had O
been O
recommended O
to O
take O
warm O
baths O
by O
Dr O
Wilmot O
and O
Mr O
Ranby O
when O

On O
20 O
August O
Lord O
Winchelsea O
, O
Higham O
' O
s O
uncle O
, O
surprised O
to O
see O
the O
boy B
so O
well O
and O
brisk O
, O
hoped O
that O
Charles O
was O
" O
now O
safe O
from O
this O
complaint O
" O
- O
the O
same O
one O
from O
which O
he O
had O
suffered O
in O
1738 O
- O
39 O
- O
but O
thought O
that O
he O
would O
never O
be O
safe O
" O
if O
he O
continues O
the O
practice O
of O
overheating O
himself O
and O
then O
drinking O
Cold O
Water O
" O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
it O
all O
, O
Charles O
was O
in O
fine O
spirits O
. O
9 O
Lady O
Malton O
dosed O
the O
boy B
with O
cinchona B
bark O
, O
which O
removed O
the O
pains O
in O
his O
legs O
and O
reduced O
his O
fever O
, O
and O
she O
was O
convinced O
that O
they O
would O
soon O
have O
" O
a O
clear O
Stage O
to O
act O
in O
a O
proper O
manner O

The O
boy B
' O
s O
mother O
was O
puzzled O
because O
the O
swelling O
" O
sometimes O
pushes O
forward O
very O
fast O
then O
retires O
a O
little O
" O
but O
the O
doctor O
and O
Ranby O
seemed O
happy O
with O
his O
condition O
. O
' O
2 O
At O
this O
point O
the O
letters O
cease O
, O
presumably O
because O
Malton O
arrived O
in O
London O
with O
his O
daughters O
, O
to O
have O
them O
inoculated O
against O
smallpox B
, O
but O
a O
later O
letter O
states O
that O
surgery O
to O
open O
the O
swelling O
was O
not O
undertaken O
. O

He O
was O
just O
the O
same O
as O
when O
he O
left O
Kensington O
, O
so O
John O
Bourne O
had O
bled O
him O
and O
the O
child B
had O
started O
on O
Sir O
Edward O
Hulse O
' O
s O
prescription O
, O
unfortunately O
not O
defined O
in O
the O
letter O
, O
but O
which O
was O
apparently O
as O
bad O
as O
the O
last O
one O
, O
if O
not O
worse O
. O

He O
bore O
the O
treatment O
well O
, O
as O
he O
had O
done O
three O
years O
previously O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
so O
successful O
that O
Lady O
Malton O
was O
" O
determined O
to O
keep O
it O
running O
full O
as O
long O
as O
I O
did O
last O

by O
the O

of O
John O
Borne O
[ O

with O
much O
ease O
to O
the O
Dear O
Child B
" O
. O
' O

She O

She O
thought O
that O
Sir O
Edward O
Hulse O
' O
s O

were O
too O
slow O
in O
taking O
effect O
although O
the O
boy B
took O
them O
very O
quietly O
. O
' O
7 O
Sir O
Edward O
did O
not O
" O
apprehend O
any O
great O
danger O
from O
the O
Siziness O
[ O

of O
Charles O
' O

; O
Lady O
Malton O
thought O
that O
the O
condition O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
the O
child B
' O
s O
problems O
, O
which O
would O
not O
end O
until O
it O
was O
set O
to O

. O
. O
and O
therefore O
Intend O
to O
give O
him O
a O
gentle O

. O
. O
and O
to O
let O
him O
take O
his O
old O
Remedie O
the O

for O
a O
few O
Daies O
which O
I O
dare O
say O
will O
set O
him O
quite O
to O
rights O
" O
. O
24 O
By O
29 O
May O
Dr O
Boume O
had O
bled O
the O
boy B
" O
which O
succeeded O
very O
well O
but O
. O
. O
. O
found O
it O
[ O
his O

] O
as O
bad O
as O
ever O
" O
. O

Lady O
Malton O
had O
called O
in O
two O
eminent O
Bristol O
men O
, O
Dr O
Logan O
and O
Mr O
Pye O
, O
to O
treat O
the O
boy B
; O
Mr O

prescribed O
" O
the O
Precipitate O

as O
the O

for O
the O

The O

had O
not O
yet O
acted O
" O
because O
his O

is O
of O
too O
obstinate O
a O
Nature O
" O
and O
Lady O
Malton O
herself O
was O
satisfied O
that O
since O
nothing O
else O
had O
worked O
to O
cure O
the O
boy B
, O
the O
time O
had O
come O
to O
try O
mercurials O

even O

she O
knew O
that O
they O
were O
" O
powerful O
and O
perhaps O
in O
some O
cases O
hazardous O
medicines O
" O
. O
28 O
She O
wanted O
to O
see O
some O
remedy O
succeed O
but O
was O
" O
afraid O
of O
violent O
ones O
and O
at O
the O

time O
vastly O
distrustfull O
[ O

of O

Charles O

, O

32 O
She O
decided O
to O
take O
the O

the O

In O

he O
was O

against O

made O
a O

after O

he O
caught O

36 O
Lord O
Higham O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
seriously O
ill O
after O
that O
until O
, O
at O
the O
age O
of O
19 O
, O
he O
undertook O
his O
Grand O

in O
1749 O
. O

Scanagati O
produced O
a O
lengthy O
medical O
report O
of O
Malton O
' O
s O
treatment O
, O
presumably O
for O
his O
English O
doctor O
' O
s O
enlightenment O
. O
37 O
The O
initial O
treatment O
was O
an O
" O
electuary O
, O
consisting O
of O
three O

three O

noted O
that O

He O
was O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O

not O
a O
useful O
character O
for O
separating O
the O
two O
species O
in O

field O

and O
that O

frequently O
fly O

The O

without O

it O

assertion O
that O

their O

more O
quickly O
than O

therefore O
counterintuitive O

comment O
is O
conjecture O
: O
while O
the O
flight O

be O
unusual O

it O

shown O
that O
it O

outside O
the O
range O
of O
variability O
of O
Pileated B
Woodpecker I

and O
cannot O
therefore O
be O
used O
to O
eliminate O
the O
possibility O
that O
it O

the O

Nevertheless O
, O
this O

to O

the O

Any O
identification O

into O

it O

out O

does O
not O

imply O
that O

out O

this O

not O
support O
the O

The O
balance O

would O
suggest O
that O

more O
likely O
