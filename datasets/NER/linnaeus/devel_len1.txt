This O
led O
us O
to O
postulate O
that O
the O

of O

the O

the O

A O
possible O
explanation O
could O
be O
that O
a O

level O
of O
nuclear O
cataract O
causes O
less O
visual O
disturbance O
than O
the O
other O
two O
types O
of O
cataract O
, O
thus O
for O
the O

could O
have O
been O
less O

have O

Possible O
selection O
bias O
arising O
from O
