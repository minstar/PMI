This O
is O
in O

with O
Cox O

study O
[ O

in O
which O
it O
was O

Pain O
is O
a O
subjective O
experience O

each O
patient B
may O
communicate O
in O
a O
different O
way O

verbally O
or O
nonverbally O

Patients B

this O

The O
duration O

could O
approximately O
be O
determined O
, O

the O

not O
known O
. O

In O
the O
usual O
absence O

be O
expected O
to O
maintain O
an O

such O
as O

may O
force O
the O

Therefore O
, O

patients B
might O
be O
expected O

differ O

in O

In O

this O

Hoffman O

[ O

demonstrate O
that O

These O
authors O
suggest O
that O
the O

can O
predispose O
for O
a O
chronic O

- O
like O
arthritis O
in O

Additionally O
Weissman O
and O
colleagues O
[ O

demonstrated O
that O
patients B
with O
SLE O
can O
display O
radiographic O
abnormalities O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
RA O
, O
although O
the O
presence O
of O
marginal O
erosions O
is O
a O
rare O
finding O
. O

In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
patients B
with O
rhupus O
show O
a O
very O
similar O
arthritis O
pattern O
( O
including O
erosive O
disease O
) O
and O
similar O
autoantibody O
production O
( O
RF O
and O
anti O

CCP O

) O
to O
those O
in O
patients B
with O
RA O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
patients B
with O
rhupus O
display O
a O
clinical O
and O
serological O
profile O
indistinguishable O
from O
patients B

Moreover O
, O
the O

of O
other O

was O
similar O
in O
all O

of O

and O

We O

, O
a O
frequency O
similar O
to O
that O
reported O

. O

The O
high O
prevalence O
of O
anti O
- O
CCP O
antibodies O
in O
RA O
found O
in O
our O
study O
could O
be O
explained O
by O
a O
selection O
bias O
because O
only O
patients B
with O
RA O
with O
an O
aggressive O
disease O
( O
namely O
erosive O
arthritis O
and O
RF O
+ O
) O
were O
included O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
mean O
ACR O
criterion O
for O
SLE O
was O
similar O
between O
patients B
with O
rhupus O
and O
those O
with O
SLE O
, O
including O
the O
' O
robust O
' O
features O
of O
SLE O
such O
as O
renal O
and O
neurological O
involvement O
, O
and O
anti O

dsDNA O
and O
anti O

Sm O
antibodies O
. O

These O
clinical O
and O
serological O
features O
shared O
between O
patients B
with O
rhupus O
and O
those O
with O
SLE O
also O
place O
rhupus O
in O
the O
SLE O
spectrum O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
small O
number O
of O
patients B
, O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
define O
the O
differential O
features O
underlying O
each O
subset O
. O

However O
, O
two O
of O
three O
patients B
negative O
for O
anti O

CCP O
antibodies O
were O
also O
negative O
for O
both O
RF O
and O
anti O

dsDNA O

. O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
shared O
clinical O

of O
RA O
( O
mainly O
erosive O
arthritis O
) O
and O

( O
including O

along O
with O
the O

of O
anti O

dsDNA O
and O
anti O
- O
CCP O
autoantibodies O
in O
our O
patients B

rhupus O
, O
our O
findings O
strongly O
support O
the O
contention O
that O
rhupus O
is O
a O
true O

, O
not O
merely O
a O
part O
of O
the O
clinical O
spectrum O
of O
the O

. O

Moreover O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
mean O
ACR O
criteria O
for O
both O
diseases O
, O
we O
have O
confirmed O
that O
patients B

have O
more O
RA O

less O

our O

showed O
that O

thus O
suggested O
that O
in O

However O
, O
if O

then O
it O

unique O
phenomenon O
characterized O
in O

from O

in O

is O
the O
freedom O

choose O
the O

they O
want O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
their O

is O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
Taiwan O
people B
favor O
the O
larger O
scales O
of O

and O
this O
fallacy O
leads O
to O
the O
phenomenon O
of O
big O
- O
hospital O

For O
example O
, O
people B
choose O
the O
medical O
centers O
which O
are O
accredited O

the O
highest O
level O
of O
medical O
science O
in O
Taiwan O
when O
they O
only O
suffer O
from O
a O
common O
cold O

In O
the O
spring O

2003 O
, O
the O
SARS O
epidemic O
viciously O
attacked O
the O
health O
of O
Taiwan O
' O

people B

The O
people B

freedom O

caused O

The O
idea O

was O
aimed O
to O
lead O
the O
Taiwan O
citizens O
to O
choose O
one O
clinic O
physician O
as O
their O
personal O
family O
physician O
for O
health O
maintenance O
and O
this O
family O
physician O
also O
would O
have O
the O
responsibility O
of O
referring O
the O
patients B

specialty O
care O
if O
necessary O
. O

From O
a O
national O
health O
authority O
perspective O
, O
they O
expected O
the O
Taiwan O
people B
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
their O
fallacy O
that O
" O
bigger O

better O
" O
for O

One O
major O

for O

that O
the O

, O
more O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
results O
of O
in O
vivo O
studies O
are O
less O
explicit O
and O
it O
remains O
uncertain O
whether O
these O
properties O
are O
relevant O
in O
human B

Nevertheless O
, O
if O
rAPC O
is O
efficient O
when O
infused O
in O
the O
early O
phase O
of O
septic O
challenge O
, O
we O
thus O
need O
to O
treat O
our O
patients B
earlier O
. O

Recent O
animal O
and O
human B
data O
have O
suggested O
that O
rAPC O
may O
improve O
both O
vascular O
and O
myocardial O
dysfunction O
and O
vascular O
reactivity O
to O
catecholamine O
during O
endotoxin O

In O
a O
retrospective O
study O
of O

shock O
in O
humans B
, O
Monnet O
and O
colleagues O
[ O

demonstrated O
that O
APC O
infusion O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
delivered O
norepinephrine O
. O

Wiel O
and O
colleagues O
[ O

] O
demonstrated O
in O
a O
rabbit B
model O
of O
endotoxin O
induced O
shock O
that O
APC O
decreased O
aorta O
endothelial O

. O

By O
contrast O
, O
in O
a O
lung O
model O
of O
endotoxin O

inflammation O
, O
Robriquet O
and O
colleagues O
[ O
11 O
] O
demonstrated O
a O
trend O
to O
an O
increased O
vascular O
permeability O
using O
high O
doses O
of O
human B
APC O
. O

This O
last O
result O
was O
in O
sharp O
contrast O
with O
the O
results O
obtained O
by O
Nick O
and O
colleagues O
[ O
12 O
] O
in O
a O
human B
model O
of O
pulmonary O
endotoxin O
administration O
. O

In O
rats O
, O
APC O
markedly O
decreased O
tumour O
necrosis O
factor O
concentrations O
whereas O
they O
remained O
unchanged O
in O
either O
human B
septic O
shock O
or O
endotoxemia O
. O

This O
mode O
of O
administration O
favours O
the O
anti O
- O
inflammatory O
effects O
of O
rAPC O
, O
which O
are O
particularly O
efficient O
in O
murine B
models O
in O
protecting O
the O
endothelium O
from O
cytokine O
- O
mediated O
apoptosis O
or O
upregulation O
of O

molecules O
. O

If O
rAPC O
is O
efficient O
when O
infused O
in O
the O
early O
phase O
of O
septic O
challenge O
, O
we O
thus O
need O
to O
treat O
our O
patients B
earlier O
. O

At O
least O
two O
studies O
suggest O
that O
treatment O
with O
rAPC O
within O
24 O
hours O
may O
carry O
a O
larger O
survival O
advantage O
for O
patients B
with O
severe O
sepsis O
, O
compared O
with O
those O
treated O
more O
than O
24 O
hours O
after O
organ O

[ O

. O

The O
beneficial O
effects O
of O
earlier O
administration O
of O
rAPC O
to O
appropriate O
patients B
may O
fit O
into O
this O
paradigm O

, O
then O
the O

In O

a O

of O
the O

were O
recorded O
within O

Some O

and O
in O
December O

the O

An O

and O
an O
additional O

Calves B
under O
suspicion O
of O
the O
arachnomelia O

were O
sent O
to O
the O
pathology O
department O
of O
the O
TGD O
for O

. O

The O
first O
was O
the O

of O
a O

that O
was O
diagnosed O
by O

investigation O
. O

In O
many O
cases O
more O
than O
one O

was O
identified O
[ O

Some O

For O
this O

the O

observing O
only O

calf B
among O
a O
certain O
number O
of O

of O
the O

in O
question O
was O
calculated O

The O
probability O
of O
observing O
an O

calf B
depends O
also O
on O
the O
probability O
that O
such O
a O

Under O
these O

if O
at O

are O
given O
for O
a O

In O
this O
case O
it O
is O
very O
likely O
that O
the O

affected O
calf B
is O
a O
phenocopy O
. O

The O
body O

These O
considerations O
led O
Blalock O
to O
recommend O
the O
use O
of O
the O
former O
except O
in O
infants B
under O
two O
years O
of O

in O
whom O
this O

may O
be O
too O
small O
and O
in O

over O
twelve O

old O
or O
five O

with O
a O

it O
is O
often O
too O

' O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
systemic O
artery O
in O
each O
individual O
patient B
is O
important O
since O
in O
certain O
cases O
one O
or O
another O
is O
unsuitable O
. O

The O
subclavian O
branch O
of O
the O
innominate O
has O
generally O
been O
preferred O
in O
patients B
ranging O
between O
two O
and O
twelve O
years O
of O
age O
and O
in O
older O
individuals O
in O
whom O
there O
is O
a O
right O
aortic O
arch O
. O

In O
one O
three O
- O
year O
- O
old O
child O
and O
one O
twenty O
- O
year O
- O
old O
woman B
a O
poor O
result O
was O
obtained O
and O
a O
second O
operation O
upon O
the O
other O
side O
was O
necessary O
. O

Excluding O
the O
patients B
mentioned O
in O
the O
present O
report O
, O
only O
in O
two O
was O
an O
unquestionably O
good O
result O
obtained O
. O

The O
patient B
was O
a O
19 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
girl O
who O
had O
been O
cyanotic O
since O
the O
age O
of O
six O
months O
. O

The O
patient B
had O
an O
uneventful O
but O
disappointing O
convalescence O
. O

Though O
the O
patient B
has O
been O
markedly O
improved O
, O
it O
is O
recognized O
that O
the O
result O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
is O
commonly O
obtained O
when O
patients B
with O
more O
adequate O
pulmonary O
arteries O
are O
treated O
by O
the O
conventional O
anastomosis O
of O
a O
systemic O
artery O
to O
the O
side O
of O
the O
pulmonary O
artery O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
patient B
has O
thus O
far O
been O
given O
such O
good O
health O
and O
relatively O
normal O
capacity O
for O
ordinary O
activity O
that O
further O
operation O
has O
seemed O
unwarranted O
, O
though O
the O
possibility O
of O
some O
future O
attempt O
at O
creation O
of O
an O
additional O
shunt O
is O
being O
kept O
in O
mind O
. O

The O
first O
patient B
was O
a O
fully O
grown O
young O
man B
of O
17 O
with O
tetralogy O
of O
Fallot O
which O
caused O
considerable O
incapacity O
. O

The O
patient B
had O
an O
uneventful O
convalescence O
. O

The O
second O
patient B
was O
a O
16 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
boy O
who O
had O
been O
cyanotic O
since O

. O

The O
operation O
performed O
in O
my O
first O
patient B
constitutes O
in O

the O
use O
of O
the O
